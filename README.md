# HR Workforce Insights: EDA & Power BI Dashboard

## 📌 Overview
Employee attrition is a critical challenge for organizations, impacting productivity, costs, and workforce stability.  
This project presents a structured **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** followed by an **interactive Power BI dashboard** to analyze employee attrition and key workforce patterns using a real-world HR dataset.

The project demonstrates how analytical exploration and visual storytelling can transform raw HR data into meaningful insights.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was conducted to gain a deep understanding of the dataset and uncover hidden patterns related to employee attrition.

### EDA Objectives:
- Examine data structure and distributions  
- Identify trends and relationships among HR variables  
- Visualize attrition patterns across demographics and job roles  

### EDA Techniques Used:
- Univariate and bivariate analysis  
- Distribution plots and categorical comparisons  
- Insight-driven visual exploration
